Hello/你好. Welcome to my website! 

I am a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at <a href='https://datascience.columbia.edu/'> The Data Science Institute, Columbia University</a>. I completed my PhD training at <a href='https://temertymedicine.utoronto.ca/'>Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto</a> and <a href='[https://www.sickkids.ca/](https://www.sickkids.ca/en/research/research-programs/translational-medicine/)'>Transitional Medicine Program, The Hospital for Sick Children</a>. 

My research interests are Clinical Decision Support for Cancer Treatment, Artificial Intelligence in Nutrition, Food Policy, Dietary Behaviors and Diet-related Diseases. I have a particular interest in NLP, multimodal deep learning, and multi-omics methods.

<!-- , and Precision Nutrition -->

<!-- I have developed hands-on experience in nutrition interventions, metabolic dysfunction, cohort studies, and food policy research, and have implemented a wide array of machine learning methodologies to deal with multi-omics and clinical time series data, histology images, food scanner data, and nutrient composition databases. I have a strong interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), and Multi-Omics approaches as they are dramatically changing how we understand food consumption behaviors and related metabolic diseases in ways that have never before been possible. -->

<!-- My current research focuses on understanding the economic, nutritional, and health costs of food purchasing behaviors across neighborhoods.
